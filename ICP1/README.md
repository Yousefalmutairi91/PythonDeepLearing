In this, I asked the user to input the given sentence and replace the word "python" to "pythons" by using the replace function.

As per asked in the assignments, I asked the user to provied the number of students which named "n", then I've created two lists, one list to save inputs in Pound and another one to list calculated values in Kilogram. After that, I asked the user to input the student's weights in lbs then converd it to kg. I used f string the print the result.

In this question I used to devide the work in many steps.
1. read the file -> file = open("word_counts.txt", "r+")
2. Add the words to the dict_count and ensure is counted and printed.
3. write the output back to the file using the "w" rather than "a" to ensure the output has been written to the file again.
